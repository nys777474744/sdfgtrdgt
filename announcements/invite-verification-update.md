Hey <@&1247890782648668281> !

I've made some **important updates** to our systems:

### 🔍 Invite Verification
- Use `/verify @user` for the 3-day verification process
- For regular invite tracking, please use the invite tracker bot instead
  > Note: Our bot's invite tracking isn't perfect yet, so this split helps ensure accuracy

### 📋 New Commands

**Priority System:**
```
/priority [level]
• low - Regular issues
• normal - for just right problems
• medium - Time-sensitive issues
• high - Urgent problems
- 
```
Example: `/priority high` for server crashes

**Category System:**
```
/category [type]
• 🖥️ server - Server setup/config
• 💰 coins - Currency issues
• 🔌 plugins - Plugin problems
• ⚡ performance - Lag/performance
• 📌 other - Misc issues
```
Example: `/category server` for server setup help

Thanks for your help in keeping everything organized! 🎉
