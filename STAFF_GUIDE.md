## Best Practices

### Ticket Handling

   - Always acknowledge the ticket promptly
   - Use appropriate FAQ commands if applicable
   - Ask for clarification if needed

2. **During Support**:
   - Stay in the ticket while helping
   - Use clear, simple explanations
   - Verify the issue is resolved before closing

3. **Closing Tickets**:
   - Ask if the user needs anything else
   - Use `/closerequest` to let users close themselves
   - Use `/close` only when certain the issue is resolved

### Using FAQ Responses
- Always read the FAQ content before sending
- Add additional context if needed
- Follow up to ensure the FAQ answered their question

### Quota Management
- Keep track of your monthly quota progress
- Help other staff members reach their quotas
- Check `/quotastats` regularly to monitor progress

## Important Notes

### Ticket Auto-Closing
- Tickets may auto-close after extended inactivity
- Users are notified before auto-closure
- Staff can prevent auto-closure by sending a message

### User Permissions
- Regular users can only close their own tickets
- Users must select contributing staff when closing
- Staff can close any ticket directly

### Contribution Tracking
- Contributing to a ticket = sending a message
- Multiple messages in one ticket count as one contribution
